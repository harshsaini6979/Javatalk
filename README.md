# Javatalk

In todayâ€™s modern and growing era, one needs to be active and connected with others. Since, everyone is quite busy, so it becomes almost impossible to connect to our loved ones. Here, social networking shows its significant role. With its help one can easily take care and be in contact of their relatives and their close friends, no matter how far they are. So, social networking is not just for fun, one uses it in his/her busy life as a need as well.
 
To conclude, JAVATALK is a console based social networking project developed using CORE JAVA and database MYSQL. It has basic elements of social networking like chat, explore, making friends and many more. Once bored, one can even delete his account as well. All the data is stored in the database, so one can easily access it anytime. Login credentials include unique User Id and Password with a minimum criterion to meet the requirement of its strength.
